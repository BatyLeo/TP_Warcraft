md"""
In this practice session, we consider the Warcraft shortest path problem. 
We have a dataset of Warcraft terrain images (source: [Vlastelica et al. (2020)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkevoJSYPB)), corresponding black-box cost functions, and optionally the label shortest path solutions and cell costs. 
We want to learn the cost of the cells, using a neural network embedding, to predict good shortest paths on new test images.
More precisely, each point in our dataset consists in:
- an image of terrain ``I``.
- a black-box cost function ``c`` to evaluate any given path (optional).
- a label shortest path ``P`` from the top-left to the bottom-right corners (optional). 
- the true cost of each cell of the grid (optional).
We can exploit the images to approximate the true cell costs, so that when considering a new test image of terrain, we predict a good shortest path from its top-left to its bottom-right corners.
The question is: how should we combine these features?
We use `InferOpt` to learn the appropriate costs.

In what follows, we'll build (and train) the following policy:

As you know, the solution of a linear program is not differentiable with respect to its cost vector. Therefore, we need additional tricks to be able to update the parameters of the CNN defined by `create_warcraft_embedding`. Two points of view can be adopted: perturb or regularize the maximization problem. They can be unified when introducing probabilistic combinatorial layers, detailed in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.13513.pdf). They are used in two different frameworks:

- Learning by imitation when we have target shortest path examples in the dataset.
- Learning by experience when we only have access to the images and to a black-box cost function to evaluate any candidate path.

In this section, we explore different combinatorial layers, as well as the learning by imitation and learning by experience settings.
