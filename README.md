## Get started

1) Before running the notebook, please download the [dataset](http://cermics.enpc.fr/~bouvierl/warcraft_TP/data.zip) and place it in a 
`/data` folder in this repository.

2) Open a Julia REPL in the folder of this repo, and run:

```julia
using Pluto
Pluto.run()
```
A browser window opens, select the `01_demo.jl` notebook to start.
Also select the `02_warcraft.jl`in another tab, it can take a while to load dependencies the first time.
